### Group thesis
   
   * For thesis done in groups, equal contributions from all group members is expected
   * In general groups have freedom to divide the tasks among themselves. If you are finding it hard to divide tasks then I can intervene.
   * In case of conflicts within the group bring it to my attention ASAP
   * Groups need to sign the authorship declaration [see here](https://www.uis.no/sites/default/files/2021-11/Group%20contract%20for%20bachelor%27s%20and%20master%27s%20thesis.pdf)
