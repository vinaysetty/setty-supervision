# Rules of supervision

There are a few simple rules I expect every supervised student to follow:

  1. **Meetings.** Either agree on a regular weekly half an hour timeslot that is used throughout the semester or for irregular meetings, make an appointment in email. If you show up unannounced, there is a good chance that I'll have to turn you away because I'm busy with other things.
  1. **Keep minutes of meetings.** Specifically, the followings should be recorded for each meeting (see [ExampleMinutes](ExampleMinutes)):
      - What was discussed?
      - What are your todos?
      - What are my todos?
      - When do we meet next?
  1. **Prepare an agenda for the meeting.** The agenda should include what you did since the last meeting and questions that you would like to discuss. It ensures that the meeting has a clear purpose. The first thing to do during the meeting is to tell me what your agenda is; if you don't have an agenda, the meeting is over. If there is anything specific you need feedback/input on, then send (a link to) the agenda a day before the meeting in email.
  1. **Create and maintain a github repository and wiki.** Supervision is two-way traffic. It's collaboration. To facilitate this, maintain a private GitHub repository that only you and I (and any other co-supervisors) can access. Keep the minutes, agendas, your document reading and research activities, experimental results, etc. here organized and up-to-date.
  1. **After the project is finished archive all the source code, datasets used, documents such as thesis or papers written including source files such as latex code and powerpoint for creating diagrams etc.See the instructions and archiving policy here (archiving)[archiving.md]
